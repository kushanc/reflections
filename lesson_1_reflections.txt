Why is it easier to compare when using Git and FC?
well the seeing the two versions made it easy to compare line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

See where you went wrong, see how the code improved
Look for common ways to improve, patterns intrinsic to a person

What are the pros and cons of choosing when to commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You can quantify the changes
YOu are aware of the different versions, easier to sift through

Git has to allow multiple files since it is an interrelated bundle of services.
Google docs is more towards traditional filing systems.

Git log can be used to look at the changes that were made to the file periodically
Git diff can be used to know the exact changes that were made on each line

By having version control we always know that the older version of the files will remain

Initialize git:
  git init
  git status
