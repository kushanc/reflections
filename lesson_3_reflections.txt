When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When using different computers to work, when more poeple collaborate

 git remote add origin (link) : used to add remote depository
 git remote -v : shows the fetch and push sites
 git push origin master: push the master branch to origins remote deposit
 git pull origin master: pull master branch from origin
