When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When using different computers to work, when more poeple collaborate

 git remote add origin (link) : used to add remote depository
 git remote -v : shows the fetch and push sites
 git push origin master: push the master branch to origins remote deposit
 git pull origin master: pull master branch from origin

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you can edit work being done on your current commit locally, incase there
are  many people working on projects

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Clone to get a Copy
Branch when trying out a new feature
Fork when making changes to someone elses project
